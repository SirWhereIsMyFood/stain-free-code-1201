"Are you tampering with the vending machine?"

I think it's time to change the scenery a little bit and go a little more zoomed in on
the vending machine to add conditional statements and a random function to appear.

I'll see what comes to mind along the way cause I'm honestly just playing around
with this.

let r = 225;
let g = 209;
let b = 97;
        // declaring variables. \\
let r2
let b2;
let g2;

function setup()
{

  createCanvas (500, 500); // SETUP CANVAS. \\

}

function draw ()
{



}

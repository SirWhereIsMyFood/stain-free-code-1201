MIDTERM Iteration by Val

" Buying a snack from the vending machine, but it's kind of a whacky adventure. "

For my final iteration, I didn't just copy and pasted then added changes to it, but I'm just
stating what I really wanted to go for. At least in here I did wanted to fix the erros
that wasn't functioning the way I would want it to, and then see what I can really add from
there + feedback from peers on last weeks review.

As I said in all sketches, I'm really just playing around with things here and there

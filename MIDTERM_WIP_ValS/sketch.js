  MIDTERM WIP by Val

  "Buying a snack from the vending machine, but it's dark souls difficulty."

  For the midterm part of this course I really think I should do scenes where something
  happens if you trigger something with a vending machine, since it's more open to possibilties
  as far as a concept goes. I also hope to focus more on the quality of scenes first, rather
  than the quantity of the actions that happens.

  As I said in my other sketches, I'm just playing arround with things here & there.

  CONTROLS:

*/

let state = preScene; /* I'm adding my scenes here */

/* Loading fonts */


function preload ()
{



}

function setup() 
{

  createCanvas (1000, 1000);
  rectMode (CENTER);
  textAlign (CENTER);
  textSize (20);

}

function draw() 
{
  background(220);
}
